# Dylan Gattey

This is a redesign of <https://dylangattey.com> to a lightweight,
mobile-friendly, polished exhibition of my projects/experiments. It's been
a slow, unchanging Wordpress site for years. I'm using a static site
generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to build it. It's hosted on
[Netlify](https://netlify.com), backed by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com),
with continuous integration based off this repo.

## Initial Setup

### Development Dependencies

You must have the following already installed:

- `HomeBrew`
- `Ruby` & `RubyGems` (`rvm` is a great tool for managing versions)
- `ImageOptim`
- `npm` to install `PurgeCSS`

### Setup script

Once the above are manually installed, you can simply run the `setup` script
to install the following:

- `Bundler`

- `ImageMagick` (make sure `webp` appears under delegates, if not and you're
  on Linux, try [this guide](https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert/wiki/Installing-Imagick-extension))

- `PurgeCSS`

## Local Development

### Workflow

1. Install the necessary gems with `bundle install`
1. Build & serve the site with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If you want autoreload, use `bundle exec jekyll liveserve`. The site files will
live in `build` and be served on `http://localhost:4000/`.

### Adding a new dependency

Add an entry to the Gemfile, add to `plugins` in `_config.yml` as needed and
rerun `bundle install`.

### Changing/adding images

Use the `process-images` script after doing so. It will optimize/minify all
jpg/png files. Additionally, it will convert those files to WebP versions and
put them back in the same folders. This allows `jekyll-assets` to properly copy
all those files on build. It can take _FOREVER_ to run ImageOptim, so be
patient. Also, you may need to run the script multiple times to get the best
results.

## Committing Code

We exclusively use branch-based development in this repo, combined with pull
requests that run automated checks.

### Branches

The main branch is `master`, which is unpushable without a pull request. New
branches are created on the fly for various PRs.

### Pull Requests

Ready for a code review? Follow these steps:

1. Commit code on a local branch with a descriptive name

1. Push to a remote branch with the same name

1. Make sure there's an [issue](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/issues) tracking
   something you're fixing with this pull request

1. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/pulls) using a provided
   template if there's one that matches what you need

1. Ensure the assignee is correct, that the
   [labels](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/labels) on the pull request reflect
   the change, and that the appropriate
   [milestone](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/milestones) is set. Also ensure
   the [project](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/projects/) reflects the change.

1. Your request will kick off quality, safety, and linting automated checks from
   [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/), [Codacy](https://codacy.com),
   [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io), [DeepScan](https://deepscan.io),
   [Hound CI](https://houndci.com), and [Stickler CI](https://stickler-ci.com/)

1. Once all checks pass and a human reviews your code, it will be rebased and
   merged onto `master` and the branch deleted! :tada:

Please follow the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
at all times.

## Deployment

> We're set up with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) managing DNS &
> [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as the CDN and CI server that hosts the site.
> Cloudflare's MX records point to [ZohoMail](https://zoho.com/mail), and points
> to Netlify as the site source. Headers/redirects are set up via `netlify.toml`
> rules.

Every commit to `master` triggers a new deploy & publish on Netlify
:tada:. By default, it uses `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build`
with some nice defaults. Merging a PR to `master` will trigger a build for you.
If you want a manual deploy, you can log in to Netlify and trigger one.

## Issues

The currently open [issues](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/issues) reflect the
top priority tasks. Each one has appropriate
[labels](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/labels) set and are categorized into an
appropriate [milestone](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/milestones).

To [open a new issue](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/issues/new/choose), use
one of the existing templates for clarity. This should set most of the
properties for you. Add relevant details and the project/milestone, and you're
all set. Issues are a requirement for a new pull request.

## Project Status

Project status is tracked under the
[main project](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/projects/2). Our milestones reflect
our version tags and are as follows.

- [x][1.0 (Marrow)](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/milestone/2): basic site up
  on Netlify/Cloudflare with barebones homepage

- [ ][1.5 (Steak)](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/milestone/1): the "meat" ðŸ˜‰ of
  the site, where all content is done, most styles done, and site is secure for
  the most part

- [ ][2.0 (Cherry)](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/milestone/3): putting the
  cherry on top! Polish, security, optimizations are all finished and site is
  done

- [ ][3.0 (Moon Grape)](https://github.com/dgattey/dg/milestone/3): future work,
  tracking aspirations and ideas

### Current integrations

- Google Analytics: setup through Jekyll plugin

- Google Search Console: uploaded a `google*.html` file to the root, plus
  fallback through the SEO plugin + a value in `_config.yml`

- Adobe Fonts (nÃ©e Typekit)

- Sitemap: through a plugin, excluding the `google*.html` file via blob
  in the config

- Autoprefixer: plugin + asset plugin based

- SEO: plugin based

- Assets: plugin based

- PurgeCSS: intalled on Netlify via build task

- Linting: through a **bunch** of Github integrations
