# Quality checks

- At logical checkpoints run `turbo check`, `turbo check:types`, and `turbo test`.
  - Always at end of task/session; also after larger changes or deps.
  - Skip tiny tweaks unless they affect types or behavior.
- Filters by scope:
  - root/config: no filter or `--filter=dg`
  - `apps/<app>`: `--filter=<app>`
  - `packages/<pkg>`: `--filter=<pkg>`
  - multiple: multiple `--filter`
- Skip shell scripts (`scripts/*`).
- Fix issues and re-run until all pass.
