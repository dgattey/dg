# Lint, Format, Typecheck

- Run `turbo check` and `turbo check:types` **at logical checkpoints**, not after every small edit.
  - Always run at the end of a task/session before reporting completion.
  - Also run after larger changes (multiple files, refactors, new features, dependency changes).
  - Skip for tiny, iterative tweaks unless they are likely to affect types or formatting.
- Skip for shell scripts (`scripts/*`) - no linting/typechecking setup for scripts yet.
- Determine the filter based on file paths:
  - Root-level files (config/, package.json, turbo.json, etc.): run without `--filter` or `--filter=dg`
  - Files in `apps/<app>/`: use `--filter=<app>`
  - Files in `packages/<pkg>/`: use `--filter=<pkg>`
  - Multiple workspaces affected: use multiple `--filter` flags
- Fix any issues they report and re-run until both commands pass.
