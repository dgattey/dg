# Component File Naming

Component files must be named after what they contain, not generic names.

## Bad names

- `shared.tsx` - doesn't describe contents
- `utils.tsx` - too generic for components
- `helpers.tsx` - doesn't describe what's exported
- `common.tsx` - meaningless name

## Good names

- `StatusIndicators.tsx` - contains `StatusChip`, `ErrorMessage`
- `OauthCard.tsx` - contains `OauthCard` component
- `ActivityStats.tsx` - contains activity statistics components

## Rule

Name files after their primary export or a descriptive grouping of related components.
