# No Unnecessary Re-exports

Don't re-export items unless package boundaries require it.

## When NOT to re-export

- Components re-exporting other components for sibling files
- Utilities re-exporting utilities from the same package
- Any re-export that could be a direct import instead

```ts
// ❌ Bad - unnecessary re-export
// components/Button.tsx
export { Icon } from './Icon';

// ❌ Bad - re-exporting across app layer unnecessarily  
// apps/web/src/components/index.ts
export { SomeComponent } from './SomeComponent';
```

## When to re-export

Only re-export when package boundaries prevent direct imports:

```ts
// ✅ Good - services re-exports db types (apps can't import @dg/db)
// packages/services/oauth/types.ts
export type { Token } from '@dg/db';

// ✅ Good - app services layer wrapping package services
// apps/web/src/services/strava.ts
export { getStravaActivity } from '@dg/services/strava/getStravaActivity';
```

## Why

- Direct imports are clearer and easier to trace
- Avoids indirection that obscures where code lives
- Re-exports should only exist at package boundaries
