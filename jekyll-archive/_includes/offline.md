When I'm not coding, I get outdoors, travel, eat, cook, and listen to a ton of
music. Soccer is my favorite sport outside of skiing, but nothing beats
the ease of getting around SF by bike. The Salktantay Trail to Machu Picchu was
the most epic backpack I've ever been on - stars without light pollution are
astounding. I'm a big fan of maps and geography too. In an alternate life, I
would have been an architect. I settle by playing Cities Skylines.
